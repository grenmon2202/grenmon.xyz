  Covering a personal journey from deep space obsession to rediscovering the overlooked beauty of the moon. It's a story headlined by a forgotten DSLR, a centuries-old spyglass, and one scrawny dude's curiosity - all colliding across 1500 light-years, posing a deceptively simple question - Why bother looking at the moon?

## I. Why Bother?

The year is 1609. A professor of mathematics at the University of Padua has just finished refining an early version of his "spyglass". He proceeds to take the liberty of handing over the rights of manufacturing said spyglass to the Venetian Senate. Once he's done bargaining for a promotion and tenure in exchange for his invention, he finally points this spyglass up at the moon. This single act of curiosity sets into motion a chain of events that propelled science forward by decades and continues to shape our understanding of the universe to this day. That professor of mathematics, was the renowned Galileo Galilei.

The year is 2023. A titleless scrawny 20-something year old dude has just found an old DSLR collecting dust in his store room. He then proceeds to conveniently forget the DSLR at home, before heading to work in Delhi. Once he's done begging his parents to somehow have the DSLR sent over, he finally points this DSLR up at the heart of the Orion Nebula. This single act of curiosity sets into motion a chain of events that has yet to propel said individual to any place of significance, or lead him to make any meaningful impact upon the world. That titleless scrawny 20-something year old dude is me.

An interesting point of contrast between my short and, as of yet insignificant, journey in the world of astronomy, and that of Galileo, is the difference between the targets we initially found ourselves fascinated by. While Galileo spent roughly two consecutive weeks out in the winter nights of 1609, observing the moon through his spyglass and drawing detailed sketches of its surface, I decided to occupy myself straight away with the study of an object unfathomably further away, buried deep in the heart of space. To be exact, the distance between our respective objects of interest is roughly 1500 light-years - 1500 light-years' worth of distance afforded to me by the efforts of one man looking up at the moon four centuries ago.

For the first year or so of my space adventures my lens' dial never budged from "250mm" - the farthest reach of my trusty Canon EF-S 55–250mm. My widefield lens simply sat in a corner collecting dust. My mindset was very much that of - "Any object not far enough to have its distance measured in light years is not worth capturing". To me the moon was nothing but an inconvenience - drowning out the lights of the faint deep space objects I was so fascinated by - there was nothing interesting about the moon. Utterly uninteresting.

Today we recognize the lunar surface in perhaps even greater detail than the people of 1609 likely knew their own neighborhoods. So why bother observing it in the Year of our Lord 2025? Besides our home planet, there is no celestial object that has been better explored than our cosmic companion. Nearly every single human in today's digital age has at some point in their life pointed their phone up at the moon and taken a picture that would have made Galileo's hair curl up. Years of observation have all but proved that there is no easter bunny up there for us to discover, there is no cosmic chef pulling out chunks of cheese from the surface and there are certainly no flying bat-people on the lunar surface. So why bother? The moon, I reasoned, is like the pair of socks you only ever wear when everything else is in the wash. 

Why bother?
