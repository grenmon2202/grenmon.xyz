The year is 1609. A professor of mathematics at the University of Padua has just finished refining an early version of his "spyglass". He then proceeds to take the liberty of handing over the rights of manufacture to the Venetian Senate. Once he's done bargaining for a promotion and tenure in exchange for his invention, he finally points this spyglass up at the moon. This single act of curiosity sets into motion a chain of events that propelled science forward by decades and continues to shape our understanding of the universe to this day. That professor of mathematics, was the renowned Galileo Galilei.

The year is 2023. A title-less scrawny 20-something year old dude has just found an old DSLR collecting dust in his store room. He then proceeds to conveniently forget the DSLR at home, before leaving for his place of work in Delhi. Once he's done begging his parents to somehow have the DSLR sent over, he finally points this DSLR up at the heart of the Orion Nebula. This single act of curiosity sets into motion a chain of events that has yet to propel said individual to any place of significance, or lead him to make any meaningful impact upon the world. That title-less scrawny 20-something year old dude is me.

An interesting point of contrast between my short and, as of yet, insignificant journey in the world of astronomy, and that of Galileo, is the difference between the targets we initially found ourselves fascinated by. While Galileo spent roughly two consecutive weeks out in the winter nights of 1609, observing the moon through his spyglass and drawing detailed sketches of its surface, I decided to occupy myself straight away with the study of an object unfathomably further away, buried deep in the heart of space. To be exact, the distance between our respective objects of interest, is roughly 1500 light-years - 1500 light-years of distance afforded to me by the efforts of one man looking up at the moon four centuries ago.

For the first year or so of my space adventures my favourite lens' dial never read anything other than "250mm" - which is the longest focal length my 55-250mm Canon EF-S lens goes to. My widefield lens simply sat in a corner collecting dust - living in the city, with all of it's light pollution, there is very little use for a widefield lens as an astrophotographer. My mindset was very much that of - "Any object not far enough to have its distance measured in light years is not worth capturing". To me the moon was nothing but an inconvenience - drowning out the lights of the faint deep space objects I was so fascinated by.

Today we recognize the surface of the moon in perhaps even greater detail than the people of 1609 likely knew their own neighborhoods. This has naturally always lead me to ask: Why even look at the moon? Besides our home planet, there is no celestial object that has been better explored than our cosmic companion. Nearly every single human in today's digital age has at some point in their life pointed their phone up at the moon and taken a picture that would have made Galileo's hair curl up. Years of observation have all but proved that there is no easter bunny up there for us to discover, there is no cosmic chef pulling out chunks of cheese from the surface and there are certainly no flying bat-people on the lunar surface. So why bother?
